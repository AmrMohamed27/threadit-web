A full-stack Reddit clone built with Node.js, GraphQL, Apollo for the backend, and Next.js for the frontend and Typescript on both.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a full-stack, fully functional Reddit clone with many features such as user authentication, CRUD operations on posts, comments and communities, and more.

## üìù Why I built this?

I wanted to create a full-stack project using technologies that I am not familiar with and learn about them, such as GraphQL and Websockets. I also wanted to explore the capabilities of the technologies I was using, and see how they could be used to build a real-world application.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project is split into two main components:

### Frontend

- **Tech Stack**:
  - React v19 and Next.js v15 using the App Router
  - Typescript v5 for type safety
  - TailwindCSS v3.4.1 for styling and responsive design
  - ShadCN for complex components
  - NextThemes for dark mode support
  - Redux with Redux Toolkit to store global state
  - Apollo Client to communicate with the GraphQL API
  - Zod for form and environment variables validation
  - TypeGraphql Code Generator for type safety and auto-completion derived from the backend schema
  - Uploadthing API for image and video uploads
  - React Markdown Editor for rich text editing in posts
- **Repository**: [Github Repository](https://github.com/AmrMohamed27/threadit-web)

### Backend

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Node.js using Express to create the API
  - PostgreSQL using Supabase for efficient relational database management
  - DrizzleORM for database migrations and access in code using an intuitive SQL-like syntax
  - GraphQL using Apollo Server for flexible API design and performance
  - TypeGraphql for type safety and auto-completion across the entire project
  - Zod for environment variables validation
  - JWT for authentication and authorization
  - Websockets for real-time communication
  - Redis for caching, subscribing and publishing real-time events
- **Repository**: [Github Repository](https://github.com/AmrMohamed27/threadit-server)

## ‚ú® Features

- User Authentication using JWT tokens stored in local storage, and email confirmation and password reset functionality using Nodemailer.
- Data stored in PostgreSQL using Supabase and DrizzleORM.
- Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete posts and comments, and create and join communities.
- Posts and comments can be upvoted and downvoted, and users can save or hide posts.
- Posts can contain images, and videos -which are uploaded using Uploadthing API-, and are creating using markdown to support formatting e.g. bold and italics.
- Users can edit their profile information, Add a profile picture, and view their own profile and other users' profiles.
- Users can start direct chats with other users, or create group chats with multiple users, where they can send real-time messages using websockets and GraphQL subscriptions, including text and images uploaded using Uploadthing API.
- Ability to search for posts, users and communities, and search through comments.
- Ability to sort posts and comments by date, popularity, and relevance, along with pagination for all queries to maximize performance.
- Support for threaded comments, allowing users to reply to comments and view the entire conversation, and collapse or expand the thread.
- Dark mode support for the frontend using NextThemes, and Fully Responsive Design using TailwindCSS and ShadCN.

## üîÑ API Documentation

### API Endpoint

The GraphQL API is accessible at: [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) if you are running the project locally, and on [https://mini-message-app-u765.onrender.com/graphql](https://mini-message-app-u765.onrender.com/graphql) if you are accessing the deployed version on Render.

### Authentication

- This API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. Include the JWT token in your Authorization header for protected routes:

  ```bash
  Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
  ```

- Authentication tokens can be obtained through the `login` mutation

### GraphQL Schema Explorer

You can explore the full API schema using:

- Apollo Studio Playground available at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) in development mode

### Core Functionality

#### User Management

```graphql
mutation Register($userData: RegisterInput!) {
  registerUser(userData: $userData) {
    ...SingleUserResponse
  }
}
mutation Login($userData: LoginInput!) {
  loginUser(userData: $userData) {
    ...SingleUserResponse
  }
}
fragment FullUser on User {
  id
  name
  email
  image
  createdAt
  updatedAt
  confirmed
}
fragment SingleUserResponse on UserResponse {
  user {
    ...FullUser
  }
  errors {
    ...FullErrorField
  }
  count
  token
}
```

#### Posts

```graphql
query GetAllPosts($options: GetAllPostsInput!) {
  getAllPosts(options: $options) {
    ...FullPostResponse
  }
}
mutation CreatePost($options: CreatePostInput!) {
  createPost(options: $options) {
    post {
      ...FullPost
    }
    errors {
      ...FullErrorField
    }
  }
}
fragment FullPost on Post {
  id
  title
  content
  createdAt
  updatedAt
  authorId
  communityId
  media
  video
}

fragment FullPostResponse on PostResponse {
  postsArray {
    ...FullPost
    upvotesCount
    isUpvoted
    commentsCount
    author {
      ...FullAuthor
    }
    community {
      ...FullCommunity
    }
  }
  errors {
    ...FullErrorField
  }
  count
}
```

#### Further Resources

For the complete schema definition and available operations, please refer to the GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio Explorer.

### Error Handling

The API returns errors in the following format:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "field_name",
      "message": "error_message"
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, if you try to create a post without a title, you will receive the following error:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "title",
      "message": "Title is required"
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows to easily handle errors in the client-side code.
